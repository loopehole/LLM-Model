# LLM Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) designed for text-based tasks such as classification or prediction. It includes:

1. **Data Management**: Efficient loading and preprocessing of data from CSV files.
2. **Model Handling**: Definition and training of a large language model using the Transformers library.
3. **Configuration Management**: Separate configuration for easy adjustments to settings and parameters.
4. **Logging**: Built-in logging to track application execution and errors.
5. **Testing**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness of data loading and model functionality.

## Key Features

- **Training and Prediction**: The project includes code to train the LLM on provided data and make predictions.
- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into modules for data handling, model definition, configuration, and logging, making it easy to manage and extend.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests to verify that the core functionalities work as intended.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: Configuration settings are loaded from `src/config/settings.py`, specifying paths and model parameters.
2. **Data Processing**: Data is loaded and preprocessed using `src/data/data_loader.py`.
3. **Model Operations**: The model is initialized, trained, and used for predictions based on the input data in `src/model/llm_model.py`.
4. **Logging**: All key actions and errors are logged using `src/logs/log_handler.py` for monitoring and debugging purposes.
5. **Testing**: The project is tested using `pytest` to ensure that all components function correctly.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm_project.git
   cd llm_project
